### ðŸ‘‹ About Me 

Hi! My name is Tommy Pett. I am a sophomore majoring in computer science in the College of Computing and Informatics and Pennoni Honors College at Drexel University. Some of my hobbies include stocks, foreign language, chess, and video games. I'm currently working full-time as an IT-Intern over the summer, and I am looking for a co-op starting in the fall.
