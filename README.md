### 👋 About Me 

Hi! My name is Tommy Pett. I majored in computer science and mathematics at Drexel University. Some of my hobbies include stocks, foreign language, chess, machine learning, and video games. I am currently working full time at Susquehanna International Group as a part of the trader tools team for SIGSports. 

There's not a whole lot of finished side-projects posted here on my github, but there are various started and unfinished ones like a IMGUI-based C++ app for some math visualizations, an Intel8080 Emulator, random assorted scripts from my senior thesis, etc...
