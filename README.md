### ðŸ‘‹ About Me 

Hi! My name is Tommy Pett. I am a junior majoring in computer science in the College of Computing and Informatics and Pennoni Honors College at Drexel University. Some of my hobbies include stocks, foreign language, chess, machine learning, and video games. I did my first co-op on the APEX team at Susquehanna international Group working on projects related to databases, rest api's, and frontends for storing info surrounding automated trading data and cryptocurrencies. I later returned there for my 2nd co-op -- following a study abroad research opportunity falling through-- where I and another dev were responsible for expanding their pre-game sports betting platform as a part of their sport-analytics team, and I am continuing to work there part time. Full time, I am taking classes in AI, ML, Tensor Calculus, Design Patterns, and finishing my Japanese Minor. I plan on continuing this next quarter where I will be taking Networks, Operating Systems, Interactive Graphics, Graduate Deep Learning, and a few electives before going off to do my final co-op. 

There's not a whole lot of side-projects posted here on my github, but one thing worth checking out is the game my friends and I made from scratch in Java as a part of our freshman design project: we're all really happy with how it turned out for all of us being freshmen.
