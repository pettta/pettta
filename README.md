### ðŸ‘‹ About Me 

Hi! My name is Tommy Pett. I am a senior majoring in computer science and mathematics at Drexel University. Some of my hobbies include stocks, foreign language, chess, machine learning, and video games. I did my first co-op on the APEX team at Susquehanna international Group working on projects related to databases, rest api's, and frontends for storing info surrounding automated trading data and cryptocurrencies. I later returned there for my 2nd and 3rd co-op where the first one was focused on expanding their pre-game sports betting platform as a part of their sport-analytics team, and after that I continued to work on that team part-time between 2nd and 3rd co-ops and right now aswell. During that period, I was and am responsible for designing, iterating, and scaling a desktop app to assist traders with in-game trading for sports as baseball, football, etc...

There's not a whole lot of side-projects posted here on my github, but one thing worth checking out is the game my friends and I made from scratch in Java as a part of our freshman design project: we're all really happy with how it turned out for all of us being freshmen.
